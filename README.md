# Real Estate Data

When I was searching apartment in Munich, I developed this small project to collect house data from online platform (immo24). It cover data for all over Germany.

It helped me:
- Collect information in real time
- Customize my preference
- Analysis the local house market
- Future investment in real-estate market

Since it might also help others for the similar purpose, I open-source the code and notebook. The website might change overtime, the code should be modified accordingly.
